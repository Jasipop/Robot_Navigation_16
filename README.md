## 📖 Project Overview
This repository contains the source code, simulation assets, and navigation scripts for the **EBU6350 Mini-Project**. The goal is to develop an autonomous mobile robot capable of navigating a known maze topology using **LIDAR** and **Camera** sensor fusion.

The system is designed to work in both a **Gazebo simulation environment** and on the physical **Yahboom MicroROS-ESP32 robot**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Below is a detailed breakdown of the files and directories included in this project:

### 🗺️ Maps & Environment
| File / Directory | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`📂 carmap_rviz/`** | **Simulation Maps**: Contains the `.pgm` (image) and `.yaml` (metadata) files generated during SLAM in the simulation environment. |
| **`📂 real_map_phase1/`** | **Real World Maps**: Contains the `.pgm` and `.yaml` files generated by scanning the physical maze with the real robot. |
| **`📂 maze_1_8m/`** | **Gazebo World Assets**: Contains the `.sdf` and `.config` files defining the 3D structure of the 1.8m x 1.8m maze for simulation. |

### 🚀 Simulation & Hardware
| File / Directory | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`📄 simulation.launch.py`** | **Sim Launcher**: The main ROS2 launch file. It starts the Gazebo environment, loads the maze, and spawns the robot model. |
| **`📄 MicroROS.urdf`** | **Robot Model**: The Unified Robot Description Format file describing the physical properties (joints, links, sensors) of the MicroROS car. |
| **`📄 map.sdf`** | *(Legacy)* Initial map file for Gazebo (superseded by `maze_1_8m`). |

### 🧠 Control & Navigation Scripts
| File / Directory | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`📄 phase1_auto_run.py`** | **Simulation Controller**: The main Python script for the **Simulation** phase. It handles auto-localization, map switching, and path planning in Gazebo. |
| **`📄 mission_real_robot.py`** | **Real Robot Controller**: The main Python script for the **Physical Robot**. It handles initial pose estimation, AMCL localization, and real-world navigation. |
